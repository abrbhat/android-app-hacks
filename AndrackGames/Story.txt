The Andrack Games
(Based on The Hunger Games)

You were chosen as an tribute from your district for the 74th Annual Andrack Games. Now you are in the arena, an island with thick dense forests.
You have been provided with an Android Smartphone and a laptop which can only run the IDE. Fortunately for you, an Android Smartphone and IDE are to you what Bow and Arrow were for Katniss.
Though there are only a few apps on your Smartphone, their source code exists on your laptop. 
There seems to be a hope for your survival and eventually being a 'Victor'.

Happy Andrack Games
and may the odds be ever in your favour.
